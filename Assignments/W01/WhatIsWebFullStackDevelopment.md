## Dice

Can't find entry-level or intern

## SUMMARY/POST

I found two jobs, one on Indeed and one on Linkedin. I couldn't find an entry level job on Dice, but maybe I'm doing it wrong. One job was with Apple as a full-stack developer and the other was with ByteDance, also as a full-stack developer. The skills they required in common were:

- Javascript, HTML and CSS
- React
- Typescript

Skills they both desired or required were:

- REST APIs
- Database

What this indicates to me is that the core technologies are not being phased out or even deemphasized. Knowing JS, HTML and CSS will likely always be desired, as they are the foundations of ultra high level frameworks and libraries. React and Typescript are the current extensions to those core technologies that are in vogue. Finally, knowing about APIs and databases in a general sense is always relevant.
